# Web Development with GoLang Workshop 🌐
## Description 📜
Go, also known as GoLang, is a modern open-source programming language developed by Google. It is known for its simplicity, efficiency & concurrency, making it ideal for building powerful & scalable applications.

The workshop is designed for **students who have some fundamental knowledge & already programmed in Go**. We will focus on web development & create our own small web app & API. The workshop combines interesting theory with practical hands-on tasks.

The workshop is spread over **2 days**, with **4-5 hours** per day. There will not be a long lunch break, but short ones every now & then.

## Requirements 📌
To ensure you're fully prepared for the workshop, you need to install & setup some things first.
- [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) 🐹 & [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 💻 with the relevant [plugins](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go). You are free to use any other suitable IDE like GoLand, but we will be using VSCode in the workshop.
